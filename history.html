            <p>The University of Missouri-Columbia got the first look at education in Engineering when William W. Hudson was appointed Chair of Civil Engineering. Once the Morill Act of 1862 was passed education in Engineering had more support. The school of Engineering was orignally a part of the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. Thomas J. Lowry had helped Engineering part from Agriculture, but then was placed back once Lowry had retired. College of Engineering has held its name since it was reclaimed in 1906. </p>

            <p>The College of Engineering held the first Engineering course taught west of the Mississippi River, the college had its first female graduate, Ada Wilson, in 1907, and created one of the first Electrical Engineering programs in the country. Thomas Edison donated an electric dynamo to College of Engineering which in turn helped Academic hall be the first building in Columbia to have electrical lighting. A couple years after the Electrical Engineering program was created, Academic Hall (known as Jesse Hall today) was burned to the ground.</p>
            
            <p>The College of Engineering kept working and growing even through the destruction of Academic Hall. Enrollment in the College of Engineering has continously risen since being create. As years pass, traditions are still being held within the College of Engineering's E-week that started in 1903.</p>
